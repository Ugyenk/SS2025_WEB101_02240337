# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Commands

In the root directory of the project, you can execute the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode.\
You can view it in your browser by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
Any linting issues will also appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
You can find more information on running tests in the [Create React App testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Creates a production build in the `build` folder.\
It bundles the application for production and optimizes it for better performance.

The build is minified and filenames include unique hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, check the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This action is irreversible. Once you run `eject`, you cannot undo it!**

If you are not satisfied with the default build tool and configuration, you can use `eject`. This command will remove the build dependency from your project.

It will also copy all the configuration files and dependencies (such as Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them. While the `eject` command will leave all other commands intact, they will now point to the copied scripts that you can modify.

Once you `eject`, you're on your own. You don't have to use this feature unless you're ready for full customization.

For most small and medium deployments, the default setup will suffice, so `eject` is generally not necessary.
